Additional features are hidden throughout the website such as the Form toggle (Just click that arrow below "Write a new tweet" in the Navigation bar), but also additional css inplementation such as dancing profile pictures within tweets, smooth color changing buttons, icons and logos, and refined text box messages and errors! playing with this page will be a fun time, i sure can say building it was!
